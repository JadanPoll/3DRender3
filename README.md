# OSG.JS WebGL Framework

[OSGJS Website](http://osgjs.org/)

## Status
**Disclaimer**: This is a static, non-NPM dependent working version of OSGJS originally created by [Cédric Pinson](https://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs). You can run it by simply opening the project in VSCode and using the Live Server extension. It might not be as fast as the original, but it works 95% as intended. All dependencies, except for benchmarks and tests, are self-contained.

## Introduction
OSGJS is a WebGL framework inspired by OpenSceneGraph concepts. It allows developers to use an “OpenSceneGraph-like” toolbox to interact with WebGL via JavaScript. Additionally, it provides facilities for exporting various assets to the OSGJS format. The API is designed to be as similar to OpenSceneGraph as possible, providing a familiar environment for veterans of the library and an accessible introduction for newcomers.

## Features
- WebGL framework based on OpenSceneGraph.
- JavaScript-based interaction with WebGL.
- Exporting assets to the OSGJS format.
- API similar to OpenSceneGraph for ease of use.
